          <p>This website was built with the intention of supporting healthcare workers and essential workers worldwide who are fighting the COVID-19 pandemic and risking their health to support the rest of us during this time. We want to let them know that we think of them often and are grateful for all the work that they do</p>
          <p>Each butterfly is a button that when clicked displays a butterfly representing the messages below the buttons. To be a part of this butterfly gratitude movement, all you have to do is click a button as much as you like for as long as you like. We believe that showing appreciation during this time is the least we could do so if you feel like you wish you could do more, just click. And then keep clicking.</p>
